# Personal Note
My first attempt to remake this game was in 2019 using MonoGame C# Windows DirectX, but the project was quickly nipped in the bud :sob:. I tried again in 2020 to learn Unity at the same time... but again, another project nipped in the bud :persevere:.
[Unity - BinaryLand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5_4I9QHWp8).

Today, I decided to restart the project to make this game again. This time, I come back to MonoGame because I am a programmer :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: and coding is my life :heart_eyes: ! So, with the help of the new updates of MonoGame, as well as .Net and others ... I will use MonoGame Android with .Net 7 (C#11.0).

I will push updates on the project from time to time. Stay tuned !

# BinaryLand (Game)
![](Documents/originalgame.jpg)
> Your objective is to guide a couple in love through a variety of vertically divided mazes to reach the goal at the top of the screen.
> What made this puzzle game particularly unique was that you controlled both characters at the same time and their movements mirror each other.
> So depending on which character you selected on the title screen, your counterpart will move in the opposite direction when moving horizontally.
> If you go left, your partner moves right and vice versa.
> This mechanic adds an interesting layer of strategy because the mazes are asymmetrical, which means that walls and entryways don't match up perfectly on each side.
> So essentially, the main challenge of the game is figuring out how to coordinate both characters as they traverse the hazards in each round.
> As an added twist, they have to meet up on the goal at the same time; anything less won’t cut it.
> Standing (or crawling) in your way are spiders and cobwebs littered throughout the stages.
> Touching a spider results in one the protagonists getting encased in webbing, presumably becoming insect dinner.
> If one of your characters run into a cobweb, he or she will be stuck flailing helplessly and you'll have to guide their counterpart around to the their location to rescue them.
> The spiders and cobwebs can be destroyed by using an unlimited supply of bug spray.
> As you encounter more hazards in later rounds, you’ll need to be increasingly vigilant about keeping track of you characters on both sides of the maze.
